# Overview
This is a repository for work related to 'Bloom for programmable storage.'

The name, ikaria, is based on [the name of an island where Icarus fell][ikaria wiki]. I just recently (and awkwardly) realized that Dedalus, which Bloom is based on, was not named directly for Icarus's father. So an alternate name will probably be thought of in the near future.

The development of ikaria will be based on [Dedalus][dedalus paper] and [Bloom][bloom home]. This may not initially be *the goto repository* for 'Bloom for programmable storage,' but it will be for my own work for now.

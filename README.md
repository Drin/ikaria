# Overview
This is a repository for work related to 'Dedalus for programmable storage.'

The name, ikaria, is based on [the name of an island where Icarus fell][ikaria wiki]. The development of ikaria will be based on [Dedalus][dedalus paper].

This may not initially be *the goto repository* for 'Dedalus for programmable storage,' but it will be for my own work for now.
